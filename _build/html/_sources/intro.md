# The Malleable Brain

One of the greatest powers and mysteries of the human brain is the ability to adapt. Both immediate changes in behavior driven by mood and attention or more persistent changes through neuroplastic changes.  "The Malleable Brain" is an exploration of how our brain changes and the consequences of our actions on our neural makeup. 

The book covers a range of topics that illustrate this plasticity. Starting with biological factors that affect brain plasticity such as genetics and aging. The book then covers how we can change our brains, through movement training, technology, and music. Finally, we discuss how the brain changes with injury and diseases.

The book is a collaborative effort of the Lake Forest College students of NEUR 388.  Overall, "The Malleable Brain" offers an exciting look at how various factors, both internal and external, can shape our brains throughout our lives.
